Purpose:
To go over:

    The theory of bottom-up parsing

Assignment:

Consider a natural language called Nihonglish with the vocabulary of English but a different grammar.

    The grammar of Nihonglish does not have have prepositions or prepositional phrases. Instead, it has postpositions and postpositional phrases.
    The topic of the sentence (often times the subject), has its own post-position: "as for"
    the verb comes at the end.

The English sentence:

I am going home.

is rendered in Nihonglish as:

I as for home to going.

And the question

Are you going to the store?

is rendered in Nihonglish as:

You as for store to going?

or more succinctly:

Store to going?

Our subset of Nihonglish has these non-terminals:
Non-Terminal	Meaning
S	sentence
PPL	post-positional phrase list
PP	post-positional phrase
T	topic
L	location
and these grammatical rules:

    S -> PPL going period
    S -> PPL going question_mark
    PPL -> PP
    PPL -> PP PP
    PP -> T as for
    T -> i (The English 1st person pronoun "I")
    T -> you
    PP -> L to
    L -> home
    L -> store

You must:

    (30 Points) Make the table for the bottom-up parser for the grammar above. (S is the starting symbol.)
        Compute the states
        Compute the parse table
